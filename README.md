# Beer.php
Little tool to secure information from the evil pretzels!

_Beer.php_ is a compatible version to an old string-replacement-tool I wrote a while ago. (See Beer.py)
Basically all it does is replace every character of the 26-digit alphabet & German umlauts with a specific amount of "BEER".
Try it! Use it for whatever reason you have to make strings unnecessarily bigger.
