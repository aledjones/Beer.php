# Beer.php
_Beer.php_ is a compatible version to an old string-replacement-tool I wrote a while ago. (See Beer.py)

Basically all it does is replace every character of the 26-digit alphabet & German umlauts with a specific amount of "BEER".
Try it! Use it for whatever reason you have to make strings unnecessarily bigger.

##Planned Features
- YAML-Documentation on BEER and a new BEER-Standard with Libraries for the most common languages
- Twitter. Just for fun.
